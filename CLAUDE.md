# SVG-BBOX Claude Code Project Instructions

## Publishing Policy

**NEVER push to GitHub or publish to npm without explicit user approval.**

- Always commit changes locally
- Wait for user review before pushing commits
- Wait for user approval before running releases
- Add this to the todo list: "Wait for user review before pushing"

## Release Workflow

**Use the automated release script for all releases.**

### Quick Start

```bash
# Release with version bump
./scripts/release.sh patch   # 1.0.10 → 1.0.11
./scripts/release.sh minor   # 1.0.10 → 1.1.0
./scripts/release.sh major   # 1.0.10 → 2.0.0

# Release specific version
./scripts/release.sh 1.0.11
```

### What the Release Script Does (Proper Sequence)

The script follows the **correct order** to avoid race conditions:

1. **Validates prerequisites** - gh CLI, npm, pnpm, jq, git-cliff, authentication
2. **Checks working directory** - Must be clean, on main branch
3. **Runs quality checks** - Linting, type checking, all tests
4. **Bumps version** - Updates package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml
5. **Generates release notes** - Uses git-cliff to generate formatted changelog from commits
6. **Commits version bump** - Creates commit for version change
7. **Creates git tag locally** - Tag not pushed yet (avoids race condition)
8. **Pushes commits to GitHub** - Triggers CI workflow
9. **Waits for CI workflow** - Monitors lint, typecheck, test, e2e, coverage (3-10 min)
10. **Creates GitHub Release** - 🔑 **Pushes tag + creates release atomically**
11. **Waits for Publish workflow** - Monitors npm publish workflow (up to 5 min)
12. **Verifies npm publication** - Confirms package is live on npm

### Why This Order Matters

**CRITICAL: Proper sequence prevents race conditions and failed releases**

- ✅ **Create tag locally first** - Prevents workflow triggering too early
- ✅ **Push commits only** - Triggers CI to verify tests pass
- ✅ **Wait for CI** - Don't release if tests fail
- ✅ **GitHub Release pushes tag atomically** - No race condition
- ✅ **Release exists before workflow runs** - Proper provenance
- ❌ **WRONG:** Push tag → workflow starts → create release (race condition)

The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by the tag push, but creating the
GitHub Release first ensures:

- Release notes are properly attached to the tag
- The release is visible on GitHub before npm
- npm package links back to GitHub Release
- Proper audit trail for compliance

### Manual Release (Not Recommended)

If you must release manually (script fails), follow this **exact sequence**:

```bash
# 1. Bump version
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version  # or minor/major

# 2. Commit version bump
git add package.json pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore(release): Bump version to X.Y.Z"

# 3. Create tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"

# 4. Push commits and tag
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# 5. Create GitHub Release (REQUIRED FIRST)
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "Release notes here"

# 6. Wait for GitHub Actions to publish to npm (automatic)
gh run watch

# 7. Verify npm publication
npm view svg-bbox version
```

### Troubleshooting

**Tag already exists:**

```bash
git tag -d vX.Y.Z          # Delete local tag
git push origin :vX.Y.Z    # Delete remote tag (if pushed)
```

**GitHub Actions workflow not running:**

- Check workflow file: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- Verify tag format: Must be `vX.Y.Z` (with 'v' prefix)
- Check workflow triggers: Should trigger on `tags: v*`

**npm publish fails in workflow:**

- Verify npm trusted publishing is configured on npmjs.com
- Check Node.js version in workflow (must be 24 for npm 11.6.0)
- Review workflow logs: `gh run view --log`

### Version Tag Format Requirements

**CRITICAL: Git tags MUST use the 'v' prefix (e.g., v1.0.12)**

The version tag format is tightly integrated across multiple systems:

1. **publish.yml workflow** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`):
   - Triggers on tags matching `v*` pattern (line 5-6)
   - Without 'v' prefix, npm publish workflow will NOT trigger

2. **release.sh script** (`scripts/release.sh`):
   - Always creates tags with 'v' prefix: `v${VERSION}`
   - Used in: `create_git_tag()`, `create_github_release()`, changelog URLs

3. **GitHub Release conventions**:
   - Releases are titled `v1.0.12`
   - Changelog links use `v${PREVIOUS_TAG}...v${VERSION}` format

4. **npm semantic versioning**:
   - npm internally uses `v` prefix for git tags
   - Package version in package.json does NOT have 'v' (just `1.0.12`)

**Version Format Summary:**

| Location                     | Format     | Example   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Git tag                      | vX.Y.Z     | v1.0.12   |
| GitHub Release title         | vX.Y.Z     | v1.0.12   |
| package.json version         | X.Y.Z      | 1.0.12    |
| npm registry version         | X.Y.Z      | 1.0.12    |
| release.sh internal VERSION  | X.Y.Z      | 1.0.12    |

**DO NOT remove the 'v' prefix** - it would break the publish workflow trigger.

### Release Script Security Safeguards

**SECURITY: ANSI Code Contamination Prevention**

The release script has comprehensive safeguards to prevent ANSI color codes from
breaking git tag creation. This addresses a critical bug where colored terminal
output contaminated version strings.

**Historical Bugs:**

**Bug 1 (Fixed in commit f1730c8):** ANSI code contamination from log functions
```bash
fatal: 'v?[0;34mℹ ?[0mBumping version (patch)...' is not a valid tag name
```

**Bug 2 (Fixed in commit f826ead):** npm lifecycle hook output contamination
```bash
fatal: 'v?[0;34mℹ ?[0mBumping version (patch)...
?[0;32m✓?[0m Version bumped to
> ersion
> node ersion.cjs

sg-bbox v1.0.12
1.0.12' is not a valid tag name
```

**Root Cause:** npm lifecycle hooks (`"version": "node version.cjs"` in package.json)
output multiline content to stdout that CANNOT be suppressed with `2>/dev/null`.

**Safeguards Implemented:**

1. **`strip_ansi()` function** - Removes all ANSI escape sequences:
   - Strips `\x1b[...m` and `\033[...m` patterns
   - Removes control characters `\000-\037`
   - Multiple sed/tr passes for robust cleaning

2. **`validate_version()` function** - Three-tier validation:
   - Empty/whitespace check
   - ANSI code detection (paranoid double-check)
   - Semver format validation: `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$`
   - Detailed error messages with hex dump for debugging

3. **npm hook output isolation (commit f826ead):**
   - Silence npm ENTIRELY: `npm version patch >/dev/null 2>&1`
   - Read version from package.json (source of truth) using `get_current_version()`
   - Check npm exit code to detect failures
   - Prevents lifecycle hook output from contaminating VERSION variable

4. **Applied in critical functions:**
   - `bump_version()`: Silence npm + read from package.json + validate
   - `set_version()`: Silence npm + verify + validate
   - `create_git_tag()`: Strip + validate before tag creation
   - `create_github_release()`: Strip + validate before release

**Defensive Layers:**

1. **Prevent:** Silence npm entirely (`>/dev/null 2>&1`) to prevent hook output
2. **Source of Truth:** Read version from package.json instead of capturing npm output
3. **Detect:** Strip ANSI codes from package.json value (paranoid safeguard)
4. **Validate:** Verify semver format before use
5. **Verify:** Check npm exit code to detect failures

**Why These Safeguards Matter:**

- **npm lifecycle hooks are unavoidable:** They're a fundamental feature of npm
- **Hooks output to stdout:** Cannot be suppressed with `2>/dev/null`
- **Capturing npm output is unreliable:** Any script that captures `npm version` output will face this contamination issue
- **package.json is the source of truth:** After `npm version` succeeds, reading package.json guarantees a clean version string
- Prevents release script failures due to colored output and hook contamination
- Ensures git tags have clean, valid names
- Maintains consistency between package.json and git tags
- Provides clear error messages when npm fails

**If Tag Creation Fails:**

The safeguards will show:
```
✗ Invalid version format: '<contaminated-string>'
✗ Expected semver format (e.g., 1.0.12)
✗ Got: <hex dump of actual bytes>
```

This helps diagnose whether the issue is:
- ANSI codes in the output
- npm verbose mode enabled
- Unexpected characters in version string
- Shell environment issues

## JavaScript/TypeScript Code Fixing

**CRITICAL: Always use the correct code-fixer agent for the language!**

- For JavaScript/TypeScript files (.js, .cjs, .mjs, .ts, .tsx): **ALWAYS use
  `js-code-fixer` agent**
- For Python files (.py): use `python-code-fixer` agent
- NEVER use `python-code-fixer` on JavaScript/TypeScript files - it's the wrong
  tool!
- The `js-code-fixer` agent runs ESLint, TypeScript compiler (tsc), and Prettier
- Can fix up to 20 JS/TS files in parallel by spawning 20 `js-code-fixer` agents
  simultaneously

## Critical Discovery: npm Trusted Publishing with OIDC

### Problem Context

After enabling npm trusted publishing for automated package releases, the GitHub
Actions workflow consistently failed with authentication errors despite having
`permissions.id-token: write` configured correctly. Multiple attempts to
manually extract and use OIDC tokens from `setup-node` outputs failed, with
`NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` appearing empty in workflow logs.

### Root Cause Analysis

**The fundamental issue:** npm trusted publishing with OIDC authentication
requires **npm CLI version 11.5.1 or later**. This requirement is not
immediately obvious in the documentation but is critical for automated
workflows.

**Version dependency chain:**

- Node.js 20 ships with npm 10.x (insufficient)
- Node.js 24 ships with npm 11.6.0 (sufficient)
- The npm version is determined by the Node.js version installed
- Using older Node.js versions makes OIDC authentication impossible regardless
  of workflow configuration

**Why manual token extraction failed:**

- Modern npm CLI (11.5.1+) handles OIDC authentication internally
- The `setup-node` action doesn't expose OIDC tokens in outputs when npm can
  handle it automatically
- Attempting to manually extract and set `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` from
  `setup-node.outputs.registry-token` is unnecessary and doesn't work
- The npm CLI automatically detects GitHub Actions OIDC environment and performs
  authentication

### The Solution

**Minimal working configuration for npm trusted publishing:**

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write # Required for OIDC

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '24' # Critical: Use Node.js 24 for npm 11.6.0
          # NO registry-url needed
          # NO step ID needed

      - run: npm ci

      - run: npm test

      - run: npm publish --access public
        # NO --provenance flag needed (automatic)
        # NO NODE_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable needed
        # npm CLI handles everything automatically
```

**What NOT to do:**

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - These are unnecessary and don't work:
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  id: setup-node # Don't need step ID
  with:
    node-version: '20' # Too old, npm 10.x doesn't support OIDC
    registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org' # Not needed

- run: npm publish --access public --provenance # --provenance is automatic
  env:
    NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.setup-node.outputs.registry-token }} # Empty, not needed
```

### Key Insights

1. **npm CLI version is critical:** Only npm 11.5.1+ supports OIDC trusted
   publishing. Check your Node.js version's bundled npm version.

2. **Automatic authentication:** With npm 11.5.1+, the CLI automatically:
   - Detects GitHub Actions OIDC environment
   - Exchanges OIDC token with npm registry
   - Generates and publishes provenance attestations
   - No manual token handling required

3. **Provenance is automatic:** The `--provenance` flag is automatically applied
   when using trusted publishing. Don't add it manually.

4. **No token extraction needed:** Unlike older authentication methods, you
   don't extract or pass tokens through environment variables. The npm CLI
   handles the entire OIDC flow internally.

5. **setup-node simplicity:** The `setup-node` action only needs the Node.js
   version. No `registry-url`, no step ID, no output capture.

### Debugging Tips

If npm publish fails with authentication errors:

1. **Verify npm version in workflow:**

   ```yaml
   - name: Verify npm version
     run: npm --version # Should be 11.5.1 or higher
   ```

2. **Check npm trusted publishing configuration:**
   - Go to npm package settings → Publishing access
   - Verify GitHub Actions is listed as a trusted publisher
   - Ensure repository, workflow name, and environment match exactly

3. **Verify workflow permissions:**

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: read
     id-token: write # Must be present
   ```

4. **Common failure modes:**
   - 404 errors: npm trusted publishing not configured on npm's website
   - ENEEDAUTH errors: npm CLI version too old (< 11.5.1)
   - Empty NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: Attempting manual token extraction with modern npm
     (don't do this)

### npm Version Reference

| Node.js Version | npm Version | OIDC Support |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Node.js 18      | npm 9.x     | ❌ No        |
| Node.js 20      | npm 10.x    | ❌ No        |
| Node.js 22      | npm 10.x    | ❌ No        |
| Node.js 24      | npm 11.6.0  | ✅ Yes       |

### Lessons Learned

1. **Version requirements matter:** Always verify the tool version requirements
   for features, not just the service configuration. npm trusted publishing
   requires npm 11.5.1+, but this wasn't immediately obvious.

2. **Modern tools abstract complexity:** The npm CLI 11.5.1+ handles OIDC
   automatically. Older patterns of manually extracting and passing tokens are
   obsolete and don't work.

3. **Documentation gaps:** Official documentation may not explicitly state
   version requirements. Web searches and community discussions often reveal
   these critical details.

4. **Simplicity over complexity:** The working solution is simpler than expected
   (no token handling, no registry-url, no --provenance flag). If a solution
   seems overly complex, there may be a missing fundamental requirement.

5. **Test locally when possible:** While OIDC authentication can't be tested
   locally, verifying the npm CLI version locally (`npm --version`) can catch
   version mismatches early.
